My zBrush Sculpting process was very good. I did take the time to mess around with Zbrush to learn the controls and where everything was located. But sculpting I felt was really good once I got the hang of it.
Re-Meshing was interesting since it was my first time using this program I was able to find a good workflow very similar to Anthonys. I would say some of the challenges were getting used
to zBrush. I felt that at times my brain would change over to Maya controls. For my model, I would say the tail was the hardest part for me getting it to curve and using all the tools that I at least know 
to make it work. Tom Brancroft's book was super helpful because it gave me a good example of expression. When I was doing my drawings I felt that is something I lacked. But after rethinking my model I felt 
that I just needed to have fun with it. But a small reflection is when I started I felt that I came a long way in a short amount of days because the program is slowly starting to click for me.
